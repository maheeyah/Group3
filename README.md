### First Segment Project Deliverable
* The selected topic and the reasoning for that selection (20 points)
We are a data analytics company who is working with a travel agency, Take Flight, to help them analyze flight data so they know what cities, airports, and holidays are best for traveling for their customers.

* A description of the data (20 points)
To answer these questions we are going to use the API provided by https://travelpayouts.github.io/slate/?python#about-api. There are many API calls that the website provides. We created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to organize the data and to see which API calls are the most effective for the purposes of the project. We decided to us "Tickets for each day of a month", "The prices for the alternative directions" and "Popular airlines" API Calls. Below is our ERD.
